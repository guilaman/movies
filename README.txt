The .csv file contains data from thousands of movies up to 2015 including cast,
budget, genre, user ratings and similar information.
The file called 'movie-data' available in .html and .ipynb format walks through
the process of data wrangling and exploratory data analysis.

This project was originally done for an assignment part of a Udacity course I
followed in the summer of 2018.
The goal of the project was to demonstrate an understanding of the data analysis
process and the use of Jupyter Notebooks.

I upload this project to my personal GitHub profile as a work sample.
